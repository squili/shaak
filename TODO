medium priority:
watch user (notify on join/message sent with cooldown)
account age gate (kick at x, notify at y)
documentation

low priority:
message link previews in set channels
ban command that does among us eject copypasta
multiple status types

on hold
ban utils (react buttons on ban, crossban with react buttons): getting bot ready for initial deployment is more important than adding another module
